Confusing is that the CTG entry says it reached primary completion in 2020, but the paper is from 2018 (and this timeline aligns more coherently with the dates of the study as it had 24 month outcomes and it started in Nov 2015). The number of patients is also substantially higher in the paper than in either registry. On balance, I'd say to conservatively include as the paper is looking at the same intervention and outcome and assume some error in the registrations."
